# Time Tracker & Productivity Analytics (Example)
This zip contains:
- A Chrome extension (manifest v3) that tracks active tab time and stores per-site totals in chrome.storage.local.
- A simple dashboard skeleton under /dashboard.
- A minimal backend skeleton under /backend (Node.js/Express).

## Installing the extension (developer mode)
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open Chrome → Extensions → Toggle *Developer mode* ON.
3. Click *Load unpacked* and select the unzipped folder.
4. Click the extension icon and use the popup.

## Notes
- This is a starting point. Improve classification, authentication, and sync to backend for multi-device data.
- The backend provided is a basic example and is not production ready.
